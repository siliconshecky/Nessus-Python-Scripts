# Nessus-Python-Scripts
Scripts I am using and have created/modified for us with Nessus files.

Grab Nessus Scans will go out to the URL you put into the script and grab the raw .nessus files from any or all scans that you want.

Nessus PArser will parse out the scans into a simpl;er csv file with what I feel is the most relevant data from the .nessus file. You can look at a Raw .nessus file, which is XML, and easily see how I mapped things out so you can add more mappings if needed. This script is based on an original script by Alexander Sferrella, which I have made some main mdoification to so it would run properly.
